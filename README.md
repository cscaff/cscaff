# Christian Scaff (*λPL. love PL*)
## I like to compute on the occasion. 

Hello! My name is Christian, and I am a Master's student at Columbia University, studying Computer Science. My research (as of now) primarily focuses on compilers, software systems, and neuro-symbolic AI.

My open-source contributions are as follows:

[Wyvern Graph](https://github.com/cscaff/Wyvern-Graph): An LLVM IR to Knowledge Graph Translator.

AlgebraicJulia: An Ecosystem of Software Based on Generalized Algebra and Category Theory in Julia.
   1. [ACSets.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/ACSets.jl)
   2. [AlgebraicOptimization.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicOptimization.jl)
   3. [Catlab.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl)
   4. [DiagrammaticEquations.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/DiagrammaticEquations.jl)

I also love concert photography.
