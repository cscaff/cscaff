# Christian Scaff *λPL. love PL*
## I like to compute on the occasion. 

Hello! My name is Christian, and I am a Master's student at Columbia University, studying Computer Science. My research (as of now) primarily focuses on compilers, software systems, and neuro-symbolic AI.

My open-source contributions are as follows:

Wyvern Graph: An LLVM IR to Knowledge Graph Translator.
1. https://github.com/cscaff/Wyvern-Graph

AlgebraicJulia: An Ecosystem of Software Based on Generalized Algebra and Category Theory in Julia.
   1. ACSets.jl: https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/ACSets.jl
   2. AlgebraicOptimization.jl: https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicOptimization.jl
   3. Catlab.jl: https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl
   4. DiagrammaticEquations.jl: https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/DiagrammaticEquations.jl

I also love concert photography.
